# Set-BrowserHomepage
Scripts to set homepages in Chrome and Firefox per machine. Initially written to be used as logon scripts in Group Policy.

# What you need to do
Read and edit these scripts carefully before executing, as they make changes to the registry for each browser. The changes will be machine-wide. You will need to fill in your environment's homepage in each script.

# Other notes
These scripts, as shared, are not signed.
